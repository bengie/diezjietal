<h2>A freelance HTML & CSS architect</h2>

<p><em>Accepting new projects starting July 2015</em></p>

<p>If you want me to get all excited about your project, <a href="mailto:greg@diezjietal.be">hire me</a> to do your HTML & CSS in a modular and scalable architecture.

<p>You can hire me as developer, consultant and as a trainer to get your in-house team up-to-date with Responsive Web Design.</p>

<p>My skill set contains: Responsive and Adaptive web design, accessibility, usability, front-end performance and UX. I like to build your project with HTML5, CSS3, Sass and a lethal dose of progressive enhancement.</p>

<p>Before we get going, I think its worth stating that I am no hardcore JavaScript programmer.</p>
