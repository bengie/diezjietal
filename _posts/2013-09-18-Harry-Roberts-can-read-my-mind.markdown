I was planning to write a presentation on modular design for designers until I bumped into these slides from a presentation by Harry Roberts (<a href="http://twitter.com/csswizardry">@csswizardry</a>). I couldn't agree more with this. So jealous that I didn't write this. <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/csswizardry/normalising-designs-for-better-quality-css">Direct link</a>
