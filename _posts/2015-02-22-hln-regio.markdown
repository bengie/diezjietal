My second project for De Persgroep publishing was a spin-off site of the current [HLN.be](http://hln.be) site. Filled with regional news and content uploaded by its users (UGC = User Generated Content). For the first release it was never the intention to make it responsive. This probably will be for a later phase. The way we built this site allows for for a minimum of effort to make it responsive.

### CSS

Our CSS approach is a combination of a modular architecture with [Smacss](https://smacss.com/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [BEM](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/)



{% highlight scss %}
@charset "UTF-8";
// DO NOT REMOVE the @charset
// old Firefox needs this


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// MAIN.SCSS
//
// import all partials here
//
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

//  We use the SMACSS approach
// SMACSS = Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS
// http://smacss.com/
// At the very core of SMACSS is categorization.
// By categorizing CSS rules, we begin to see patterns and can define better practices around each of these patterns.
// There are five types of categories:
// 1. Base
// 2. Layout
// 3. Module
// 4. State
// 5. Theme

@import 'site-settings';
@import 'mixins';
@import 'base/base';
@import 'layout/layout';
@import 'modules/modules';
@import 'states/states';
@import 'theme/theme';

### Javascript

"F*$k jQuery" is our motto. Not that we don't like [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), we just think it bloats our codebase because a lot of what it contains we don't use at all and because of all the custom development we have to do. We use microframeworks like [Bonzo](https://github.com/ded/bonzo) and [Qwery](https://github.com/ded/qwery) to handle any cross-browser issues and to simplify the way we write JS. We already have our own custom library which we can use across various projects.
