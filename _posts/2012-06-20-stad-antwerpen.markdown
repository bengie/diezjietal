## My role

The guys from <a href="http://syntetik.be">syntetik</a> asked me to finish up what was already started on the front-end. I had to slice up the last designs and optimize the layout at certain breakpoints. As this was a mobile-only project I could use a lot more cutting edge CSS3 features without the necessary fallbacks for those retarded browsers.

## Technologies:

HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, [Geolocation](http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html) [API](http://diveintohtml5.info/geolocation.html) ([more](http://html5doctor.com/finding-your-position-with-geolocation/)), [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/), [Less](http://lesscss.org).
