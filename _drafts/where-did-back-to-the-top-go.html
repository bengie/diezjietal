			<p>Why did we stop including Back To Top links on our pages? Did I miss something?</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Think about your users</h2>
		<p>Lately I've been wondering why so little sites these days offer the handy <strong>Back To Top</strong> links. Did some obscure Usability guru decide we no longer need this? Is it because it's not cool and dates from the Web 1.0 era that designers no longer include it in their designs? <strong>I want them back!!!!!!</strong>.</p>
		<p>Okay, not all pages require them. Putting such a link on a page whose entire content is visible would produce frustration when a user sees no effect and on mobile browsers you can always tap the top bar to scroll back up</p>
